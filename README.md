# User-Control-System
**·** User-control system is a simple system to manage users who have registered.</br>
**·** From web to server, I achieved it in one month. Next, I am supposed to improve the user's feeling and merge some same codes to optimize the project.</br>
**·** Meanwhile, **a demo is on the another branch** and you can download it to your local environment to have a test.
